The Smart Trash Bin is an IoT-based solution aimed at improving waste management efficiency. This innovative project uses ultrasonic sensors to monitor the fill level of the trash bin and a microcontroller to process the data. When the bin reaches its capacity, the system automatically sends real-time notifications to municipal authorities via a Wi-Fi module, ensuring timely waste collection and preventing overflow. By integrating IoT technologies, the Smart Trash Bin promotes a cleaner and more sustainable environment. It is designed to be scalable and suitable for smart city applications, contributing to efficient waste management practices.
